					<h2>Problems</h2>

					<p>Had trouble making a new folder for lab 7, was able to solve problem by asking my TA for help. Also had trouble with my code working. I would get the pop-up of asking for my name but it wouldn't display it on the Script Output. Was able to fix it during lecture, thanks to Wes for going over Lab 7. </p>
