	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure 
		on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I don't know why but the changes I make in my Lab 3 css folder doesn't 
		show up on my local file, don't know if it will fix when I upload it to my desktop. Also having trouble 
	uploading my images even though I was able to upload some before. Update, I figured out why my changes
	weren't working. I forgot to link the css to the lab 0_0</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This assignment was pretty easy. I kind of forgot it was due today, so I had to rush a bit, 
		but overall was a roll in the park.</p>
