				<h2>Problems</h2>

				<p>This lab was easy but I ran into a problem along the way. When 
					I had finished typing out my code and went to check it on my local 
					web and it wasn't working. I spent around an hour trying to figure out 
					what I had done wrong until I gave in and asked WesBot. Turns out
					I spelled id="submit" as id="submitbutton" in my html when my js code
					had it as "submit" (à¸‡ Í à²¥_à²¥)à¸‡</p>
